# Twitter-Personality-Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict MBTI personality of twitter users by taking their recent 50 tweets posted on Twitter. The data considered has 8675 users data which has 2 columns, first their personality type, the second column is a string consisting their recent 50 tweers on twitter.
This project is an application of Natural Language Processing, as well as implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms.
 The model to be trained is a Supervised learning model. It is a classification problem, beginning with simple logistic regression, tree classifiers, support vector classifiers, better performing algorithms like boosting algorithms were applied. XGBoost and CatBoost performed well than other algorithms, with an F1-score of 0.67.
